        <h2>Photography and Videography</h2>
        <p class="card-text">Photography is more than just a hobby; it's a passion that allows me to capture moments frozen in time. When I pick up my camera, the world transforms into a canvas, and I become the artist, painting with light and shadows. The thrill of framing the perfect shot, adjusting settings, and waiting for the right moment is an exhilarating experience.

            Exploring different genres of photography, from landscape to portrait, allows me to constantly challenge myself and grow as a photographer. Each click of the shutter brings a sense of satisfaction, as I know I've preserved a unique perspective of the world. Whether I'm chasing the golden hour's warm glow or capturing candid expressions, every photo tells a story, evoking emotions and memories.
            
            Photography connects me with people, places, and cultures. It's a tool that transcends language, allowing me to communicate and share my perspective with the world. As a hobbyist photographer, I'm on a never-ending quest to capture beauty, convey meaning, and inspire others through the lens of my camera.</p>

                <h2>3.The Mag!c</h2>
               <p>Once a famous poet said <b>"Its in her eyes that the magic resides"</b> .Eyes are the windows to the soul, delicate orbs of perception that reveal the depths of our emotions with a mere gaze. They are the storytellers of unspoken narratives, reflecting the tapestry of our experiences through the dance of light and shadow. In their depths, one can glimpse galaxies of dreams and oceans of wisdom, waiting to be explored. These twin orbs, framed by lashes like curtains to a timeless theater, hold the power to captivate, enchant, and mirror the universe within. Eyes are the silent poets that etch the human spirit onto the canvas of existence, inviting us to peer into the mysteries of the soul.</p>
